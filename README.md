# PackPlanner
This is a simple program which helps you plan what to pack for a trip or if you would simply want to have a planner!

Note that thirs program works in the terminal only, for now. I might sometime in the future check out the [rich](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich) library for developing a fancier TUI.

There is room for lots of improvement, wrote this in a matter of hours with no refactoring. üëç
